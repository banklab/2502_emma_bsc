//This is my second model. With this model I first want to recreate the history of the sihek: After the bottleneck has sets the equilibrium population to 16 individuals, they mate based on low relatedness for 35 ?? years. This was done in different breeding facilities, increasing the population size to 140 individuals. After this, I want to simulate different reintroduction strategies. 8??? Individuals are picked from the captive population to be introduced to the wild. There they will mate at random.

	initializeGenomicElement(g1, 0, 99999); //g1 has length 10'000 bases
