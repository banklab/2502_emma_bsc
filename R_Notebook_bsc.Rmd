# Introduction

This is the R code for my Inbreeding management model. I used SLiM to generate data and R to then analyze it. 


## Generating Data in SLiM with Parameters from R

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) #clear R environment

options(scipen = 999) #scientific notation penalty, with this R does not use scientific notation for numbers

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/BC thesis") #setting the working directory


#Here i could soft code the variables of the model, maybe the different management strategies (maybe better in SLiM...?)
#parameters will be hard coded in SLiM

#ALso I have to add a codeblock - so it will send all informations needed to SLiM

```



```{r}


```
