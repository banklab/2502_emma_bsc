This notebook is for analyzing the outputs from the model2 in SLiM. 
The working directory is set to a folder on the server, where i saved my outputs of this simulation. 

```{r}
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) #clear R environment

#All of the followind were done with recombination rate of 1e-7
#This one is for 8-500 ind, mating for 100 gen
#setwd("/tmp/server_data")

#This one is for 8-500 ind, mating for 5000 generations
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_model25000")

#This one is for 8-100 ind, mating for 1000 generations
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_model2_100_1000")

#This one is for 8-62 ind, mating for 100 gen
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_model2_62_100")

#This one is for 8-62 ind, mating for 100 Gen RANDOM
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_model2_62_100_r")

#This one is for a recombination rate of 1e-6 - 8-62 ind, mating for 100 Gen RANDOM
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_1e-6_model2")

#This one is for a recombination rate of 1e-8 - 8-62 ind, mating for 100 Gen RANDOM
#setwd("/tmp/server_data_1e-8_model2")

#This one is for a recombination rate of 1e-9 - 8-62 ind, mating for 100 Gen RANDOM
setwd("/tmp/server_data_1e-9_model2")

list.files()
# find all the SLiM output files
files <- list.files(pattern = "model2_reps")


# loop through and extract metrics -> I want relatedness at the beginning and heterozygosity at the end
res_list <- lapply(files, function(f){
  dat <- read.table(f, header = FALSE)  
  data.frame(
    relatedness_start   = dat[1, 2],
    relatedness_end = dat[2,2],
    heterozygosity_start = dat[1,3],
    heterozygosity_end  = dat[2, 3]
  )
})

# 4) bind into one data.frame
df <- do.call(rbind, res_list)

```


And now make the plot
```{r}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
# 5) quick base‐R scatterplot
plot(
  df$relatedness_start,
  df$heterozygosity_end,
  xlab = "Starting relatedness",
  ylab = "End heterozygosity",
  main = "Rel start vs Het end",
  pch = 19,
  cex = 0.4
)

# (optional) add a linear fit
abline(lm(heterozygosity_end ~ relatedness_start, data = df), col = "#54BFB7FF", lwd = 2)


# Pearson’s correlation
pearson_res <- cor.test(
  df$relatedness_start,
  df$heterozygosity_end,
  method = "pearson"
)
print(pearson_res)

# 5) quick base‐R scatterplot
plot(
  df$heterozygosity_start,
  df$heterozygosity_end,
  xlab = "Starting heterozygosity",
  ylab = "End heterozygosity",
  main = "Het start vs Het end",
  pch = 19,
  cex = 0.4
)

# (optional) add a linear fit
abline(lm(heterozygosity_end ~ heterozygosity_start, data = df), col = "#54BFB7FF", lwd = 2)

# Pearson’s correlation
pearson_res <- cor.test(
  df$heterozygosity_start,
  df$heterozygosity_end,
  method = "pearson"
)
print(pearson_res)



```



```{r}
plot(
  df$relatedness_start,
  df$heterozygosity_start,
  xlab = "Starting relatedness",
  ylab = "starting heterozygosity",
  main = "Relatedness vs Heterozygosity",
  pch = 19,
  cex = 0.4
)

# (optional) add a linear fit
abline(lm(heterozygosity_start ~ relatedness_start, data = df), col = "#54BFB7FF", lwd = 2)


# Pearson’s correlation
pearson_res <- cor.test(
  df$relatedness_start,
  df$heterozygosity_start,
  method = "pearson"
)
print(pearson_res)

```
